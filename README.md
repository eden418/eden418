About Me

I'm a software engineer with a passion for mobile application development, specializing in Xamarin Forms and C#. My expertise lies in creating responsive and fast user interfaces, as well as integrating web services through APIs for efficient cloud data management. With a strong background in logic and problem-solving, I excel in understanding client requirements and translating them into effective technical solutions.

I'm currently a second-semester student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León. Apart from my academic pursuits, I am a self-taught programmer, constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in the ever-evolving field of software development.

Projects

Here are a few noteworthy projects I've worked on

Mobile Inventory Management App - Contributed as a front-end developer in a team project to build an inventory management application for a warehouse. Utilized Xamarin Forms, C#, and RFID tags for real-time tracking, along with a backend server and PostgreSQL database for data storage.
